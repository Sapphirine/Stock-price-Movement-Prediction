<p>Jython and CPython are two different implementations of Python language. Even though Python language exists as a standalone framework, there are fundamental differences between its C/C++ and Java backends. Python became mainstream in early 90s as an effort to replicate Matlab-like software, providing a free and open-source option. Given the maturity of C/C++ and its widespread use in scientific community at the time, most scientific Python packages are implemented using CPython. This is partly due to the fact that C/C++ provide better performance than Java for scientific use. Since CPython dominates the scientific community, its stack of scientific tools is much larger and mature compared to Jython.
Hadoop provides various application programmer interfaces(APIs) for various languages including C, C++, Java, Pyhon. Since Hadoop is implemented in Java, the API provided by Hadoop community is Jython based. This is a limiting factor for implementing a project in Python on Hadoop that incorporates machine learning concepts given the lack of tools that are available for such use in Jython. Our research for finding a Python library/toolkit for implementing the stock price movement prediction application resulted in the following choices: Hadoop Streaming, Dombo, Pydoop, Hadoopy, and mrjob.</p>

<p>In order to qualify these tools for our use, we determined the requirements for our application and investigated similar applications that have been implemented by various individuals. We decided to use scikit-learn for the machine learning tools our application requires. This was our best option given the language for reasons we explain later in this report. Scikit-learn is a third party library with various dependencies that are also third party libraries with C/C++ base(Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib). Our primary goal was to choose a Python API that would allow us to use these third party libraries alongside standard Python packages. We found out that these libraries were supported via pydoop as its underlying framework was Hadoop pipes. Hadoop provides pipes to C/C++ among its native APIs that C/C++ processes can communicate and run on Hadoop framework. Pydoop provides a wrapper around Hadoop pipes via Boost providing a clean and native CPython environment for development. A massive advantage of Pydoop over other Python Hadoop APIs is its ability to provide separation between HDFS and MapReduce. Pydoop provides a Python HDFS API, which is not available in other solutions. If used effectively, Hadoop’s distributed file system can be utilized for various parallel processing applications that do not necessarily use Hadoop’s YARN. Another extremely crucial factor was Python version these possible APIs supported. Pydoop was able to provide us with the support required since it supports every Hadoop version from v1.1 to v2.5.1.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As mentioned earlier, we selected scikit-learn as the python library to perform supervised machine learning tasks required for our project. We evaluated various other tools for the same purpose including StatsModels, PyMC, Shogun, Gensim, Orange, and PyMPVA. We selected scikit-learn among these possible solutions because of its simple api, performance, and very wide user base. Based on the personal experience of the group members, we also knew that scikit-learn was extremely well integrated with mainstream 3rd party applications such as pandas, scipy, numpy, and matplotlib, which has extensive use and various functionalities that make Python attractive in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Installation for these tools was quite straightforward on Ubuntu environment while they posed quite a few issues in Mac OS X. For instance, the compiler options for wrapped Boost libraries were not compatible with Mac OS X as the version of clang did not support these options yet. This is understandable as these packages are fairly new(~4 years) and are developed on debian based environments. In order to keep the hardware configuration uniform compared to our mahout solution, we used the virtual machine provided by the course. This resulted in a smooth set of installations of our development environment.</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We used the identical technique to Mahout version(please see earlier in this report), in order to perform the supervised machine learning techniques required. Scikit-learn provides SGDClassifier methods via sklearn.linear_model. We used 90% of the data as training set and 10% of the data for testing our findings. As the demo specific to pydoop version in the following link displays(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3zVC7mFzDA&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3zVC7mFzDA&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>), we were able to run our model and test its validity, comparing it to Mahout version. As we discuss in the conclusion, our results were consistent.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Our experience using Pydoop and scikit-learn was somewhat mixed. The most challenging part was being able to parse the information into numpy arrays. Pydoop’s hdfs interface provided us with the ease of use required, however not-so well documented object oriented mapreduce implementation did complicate our implementation. Based on our experience, we would like to try mrjob instead of pydoop and implement the SGD application ourselves instead of using SGD. Although more complicated, this would more likely yield in smoother product development. This version, however, would require more time and effort than the current one, possibly turning into a semester long project by itself.`</div></blockquote>
